\section {Security Properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Authentification}: When $B$ receives the first message $ \{|A,N_A|\}_{K_{AB}}$,
            he can't be sure that $A$ sends it to him. But after receiving $\{|A, \tau, \lambda, K_{AB}|\}_{K_{BS}}$
            from $S$ he can be sure of the origin of the first message. Indeed, $A$ uses $S$ to authenticate to $B$. Since the
            message containing $A$â€™s identity is encrypted with $K_{BS}$, $B$ can be sure that $A$ initiated the conversation.
    \item \textit{Key confirmation}: After receiving the third message, $B$ obtains the session key $K_{AB}$ from $S$.
                To confirm possession of this key, $B$ sends back to $A$ the value $N_A + 1$, encrypted under $K_{AB}$.
                This proves to $A$ that $B$ has indeed obtained the correct key.

    \item \textit{Secrecy}: Nobody except for agents $A$ and $B$ know the session key $K_{AB}$.
    \item \textit{Integrity}: Each message is encrypted with a symmetric key, ensuring that only an entity possessing
            the corresponding key ($K_{AB}$, $K_{AS}$, or $K_{BS}$) can modify its contents.
