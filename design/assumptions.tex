\section{Assumptions}


We assume that at the beginning of the protocol agents $A$ and $B$ know the public key $K_{pub(C)}$ of any agent C.
Moreover, we assume that all agents $C$ shared a symmetric key with a trusted server $S$, named $K_{CS}$. $N_a$
is a nonce generated by $A$, and $N_b$ is a nonce generated by $B$. $\tau$ and $\lambda$ respectively denote a timestamp
and a lifetime. $A$ generates $K_{AB}$ with perfect randomness at each session.
