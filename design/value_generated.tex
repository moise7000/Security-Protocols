\section{Value Generated}

- $N_A$ is a nonce generated by $A$. \\
- $K_{AB}$ is a symetric between $A$ and $B$ generated by $A$. \\
- $\tau$ is a timestamp generated by $A$ based on the clock synchronized by $S$. \\
- $\lambda$ is a duration generated by $A$, small enough to be secure but long enough to establish a communication. \\
