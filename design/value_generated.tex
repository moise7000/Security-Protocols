\subsection{Value Generated}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_A$ is a nonce generated by $A$.
    \item $K_{AB}$ is a \textit{perfectly} random symmetric key generated by $A$.
    \item $\tau$ is a timestamp generated by $A$ based on the clock synchronized by $S$.
    \item $\lambda$ is a duration generated by $A$, small enough to be secure but long enough to establish a communication.
\end{itemize}
