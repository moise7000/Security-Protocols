\subsection{Analysis}
\subsubsection{Pros}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simpler and shorter protocol.
    \item $A$ can decide when to access the session because he is responsible for sending the ticket $\{|A,B,K_{AB},N_a, \tau, \lambda, pub(A) |\}_{K_{BS}}$.
    \item $A$ can verify the authenticity of the ticket’s origin.
    \item Maintains mutual authentication between $A$ and $B$.
    \item $A$ can prove the server’s participation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $B$ cannot verify the authenticity of the ticket $\{|A,B,K_{AB},N_a, \tau, \lambda, pub(A) |\}_{K_{BS}}$.
    \item $S$ does not know whether $B$ has actually received the key $K_{AB}$.
    \item $B$ must trust without verification.
    \item $B$ cannot prove the server’s participation.
\end{itemize}
