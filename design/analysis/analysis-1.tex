\subsection{Analysis}
\subsubsection{Pros}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ can decide when to access the session because he is responsible for sending the ticket $\{|A,B,K_{AB},N_a, \tau, \lambda, pub(A) |\}_{K_{BS}}$ to $B$.
    \item $A$ can verify the authenticity of the ticket’s origin.
    \item Mutual authentication between $A$ and $B$.
    \item $A$ and $B$ can prove the server’s participation.
    \item $A$ and $B$ authenticate each other through nonces and hashes.
    \item Replay attack prevention with $\lambda$ and $\tau$.
    \item $A$ and $B$ verify the authenticity of the server.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex and lengthy protocol.
    \item If clocks are not synchronized, timestamps can be exploited.
    \item If $S$ is compromised, all communications are vulnerable.
\end{itemize}
