\subsection{Analysis}

\subsubsection{Pros}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Very short and very simple protocol.
    \item $A$ can decide when to access the session because he is responsible for sending the ticket $\{|A,B,K_{AB},N_a, \tau, \lambda, pub(A) |\}_{K_{BS}}$.
    \item $A$ can verify the authenticity of the ticket’s origin.
    \item Maintains mutual authentication between $A$ and $B$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cons}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ does not know whether $S$ has processed his request.
    \item $A$ does not know when $B$ has received the key $K_{AB}$.
    \item No indication of success from the server.
    \item $A$ could send messages before $B$ has received the key $K_{AB}$.
    \item Impossible to prove the server’s participation (lack of non-repudiation).
\end{itemize}
